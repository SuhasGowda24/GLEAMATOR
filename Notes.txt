Programming- Is the process of giving clear instruction to a computer to perform specific task.

Python- Is a high-level Interpreted language and general purpose Programming language, It is known for its simple syntax and readability.

Syntax- Refers to the set of rules that define how python code must be written 
1. Indentation- Is the proper spacing of which is used at begining of line to define blocks of code in python
Note: Python is Case Sensitive

Day-2

Variables- Is a container which is used to store a value.

Rules of declaring a Variable:
1. Variable names should start from letters or underscore.
2. It cannot start with a number.
3. It should not contain space.
4. Special characters are not allowed except underscore.

Python is known as dynamically type: Because we dont declare the data type explicitly.



Day-3

TYPE CONVERSION: Changning one data type to another data type  
2 types-
1.Implicit (Upcasting): Python automatically converts smallerdata types into bigger data types
  Mainly works with Int, Boolean, float & Complex data types it doesnot works with string as mathematically in that case we go with explicit conversion. 
2. Explicit (Type Casting): The data types are converted manually
  
When 10/2 is performed - 5.0 is obtained as float

Day-4

1. For Loops:
Syntax: 
For Variable in sequence/range: 
                Statements

We use for Loops when we know how many times we want to repeat a perticular iteration also when we are working with sequences like range string list etc we go for for-loop it is mostly used for count control repetition

2. While Loop:
Syntax:
while condition:
      Statements

we use while loopwhen we dont knowhow many times the loop should run it always depend on condition it continues until condition becomes false it is mostly used for condition control repetition.
