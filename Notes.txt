Programming- Is the process of giving clear instruction to a computer to perform specific task.

Python- Is a high-level Interpreted language and general purpose Programming language, It is known for its simple syntax and readability.

Syntax- Refers to the set of rules that define how python code must be written 
1. Indentation- Is the proper spacing of which is used at begining of line to define blocks of code in python
Note: Python is Case Sensitive

Variables- Is a container which is used to store a value.

Rules of declaring a Variable:
1. Variable names should start from letters or underscore.
2. It cannot start with a number.
3. It should not contain space.
4. Special characters are not allowed except underscore.

Python is known as dynamically type: Because we dont declare the data type explicitly.



Day-2

TYPE CONVERSION: Changning one data type to another data type  
2 types-
1.Implicit (Upcasting): Python automatically converts smallerdata types into bigger data types
  Mainly works with Int, Boolean, float & Complex data types it doesnot works with string as mathematically in that case we go with explicit conversion. 
2. Explicit (Type Casting): The data types are converted manually
  
When 10/2 is performed - 5.0 is obtained as float
